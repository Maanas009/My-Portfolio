            <p>     I personally don't have "one" favourite hobby but for now I am going to speak about cricket. A very good thing about cricket is that, like quite a few sports, excercises your whole body. This means that playing cricket increases your stamina and strengthens all your muscles.
                Cricket is a sport played with a flat peice of wood with a handle called a bat, and a ball made of leather on the outside and cork on the inside. The bat's flat end is made a special wood called willow. Which comes in two types, english willow and kashmir willow. The handle is made of bamboo. The stadium has a pitch in the middle usually made of dried grass and soil and lots of short gree grass sorrounding it. The pitch is shaped as a long rectangle and its short ends have "wickets" on them. These wickets are made of three long, round and moderately thick sticks with two much smaller sticks on the grooves on top of the bigger sticks. These can be easily be knocked over by the ball. 
                    Each match, two teams play against each other. Each team has 11 players and 1 substitute. At once, each team either bowls or bats. The bowlers bowl at the batsman from the other team. The batsman score by hitting the ball with the bat and running between the wickets. The batsman get out if they miss the ball and it hits the wickets, if a fielder catches the ball without it touching the ground, if a batsman hasn't reached the other wicket yet and someone throws the ball at the wicket, etc. Cricket is definitely my favourite sport and one of my favourite hobbies.
